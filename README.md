# roboticPlotter
2D Robotic Plotter is an embedded system that works based on the principle Computer Numerical Control. Robotic 2D Plotter basically works with two stepper motors and a servo motor, wherein the robot plots the input given from the computer on the drawing board using ATMEGA 328p microcontroller on an open-source physical computing platform Arduino. The Robotic 2D plotter has a two axis control and a special mechanism to raise and lower the pen. Each axis is powered and driven by using an Arduino compactable driver L293D. Pen control is achieved using a servo. The X and Y axis mainly consists of step- per motors taken from CD- drives. The software used for programming the Arduino board are namely Inkscape (0.48.5), Processing (3.0.2), Arduino IDE. The correct and eﬃcient arrangement and proper use of the programs along with the circuit makes up an eﬃcient 2D Robotic Plotter (CNC).
